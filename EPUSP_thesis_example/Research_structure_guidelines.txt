Introduction
-------------------
Elaborate about the context, history, problem and why it is relevant.
Elaborate about what has been done.
Elaborate about the gaps.
What is the research objective (primary and secondary) and why it is relevant 
for science?
Elaborate about the methodology in a more abstract way than in its specific 
section.
What is the structure of the document.

Literature review
-------------------
Sistematic review of related literature up to the state of the art.
Highlight advantages, disadvantages and gaps of current knowledge.
What is the objective in more detail and how it fills the gap.
Can the objective's results be verified?
Justify how the results will be measured.

Methodology
-------------------
What are the materials, procedures, tools, and technology that are used and 
why they were selected?
How is the objective fulfilled (methods) and why choose this approach?
How are the results/hipothesis tested and why it is the best choice?
Indicate limitations and potential solutions to the methodology proposed.

Results
-------------------
Describe the results and how they were achieved (proofs).
Critique analysis of results and their evidences (simulations, observations, 
etc).
Relate cause and effect, make generalizations through observations and 
analysis, explain contradictions, define limitations, suggest further 
research.
Justify everything with evidence or logic.

Conclusion
